Let's start with the definition. More specifically, the one that can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring" target="_blank">this Wikipedia article</a>.

## The first definition (not so good)

>“Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code, changing the factoring without changing its external behavior.”
>
>-- <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

The definition is correct from the point of view of a trainer, someone who **already has this knowledge** that you want to convey. However, words convey nothing beyond what they merely express. That is, from it we can extract:

* Technique (The **action**)
* Software engineering (The **scope**)
* Restructure a code (The **what**)
* Without changing your behavior (The **how**)

If we stop to think for a moment and are able to put ourselves in the point of view of a learner, we will be able to detect in it the absence of the two truly important parts, the most essential to transmit the concept. These are the **why** and the **for**.

## The second definition (much better)

Let us now see, on the contrary, how refactoring is described in the following definition, extracted from the book *Refactoring Workbook*, written by William C. Wake.

>“Refactoring is the art of improving the design of existing code in a safe way. It provides us with ways to organize problematic code and gives us guidelines to improve it.”
>
>-- <cite>William C. Wake</cite>

From it we continue to extract:
* The **action**, in a perhaps more accurate way, focused on craftsmanship in “the art of”.
* The **scope**, in “the design of a code”.
* The **what**, in “organizing a code”.
* The **how**, in “in a safe way”. 

But we also have:
* The **why**, in “problematic code”.
* The **for**, in “improving the design”.

## Conclusion

The purpose of refactoring is to improve the design of the existing code.
